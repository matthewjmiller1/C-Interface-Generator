This is a Python script to generate C code to support OO-like interfaces which
can then be compiled with gcc.  See the docstring in the script for more
details.  The basic usage is:

c_intf_gen.py <interface description file>

The abs_factory directory gives a complete example of how this can be used to
implement the abstract factory design pattern:

This script requires Python 2.7+.

The motiviation for writing this script is a lot of OO-design principles can be
done with just interfaces (i.e., without type inheritance).  Many of the GoF
Design Patterns can be done with just interfaces and the Go language strongly
favors interfaces for OO design.  For a good overview of the importance of
interfaces:

Obviously interfaces can be done in C, but it takes a fair amount 
of "boring", error-prone code to setup all the relationships between structs.
So, this attempts to generate most of the "boring" code required to support
interfaces to make their usage easier.
