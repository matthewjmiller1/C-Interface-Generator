This gives a working example of how to use the c_intf_gen.py script.  Assuming
the script is in the parent directory, all you should need to do is:

make all
./test_abs_factory

If the script is located elsewhere, adjust the GEN_SCRIPT variable in the
Makefile.

The example is based on the abstract factory design pattern given in Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory

Namely, it creates a Windows and OSX GUI factory conforming to the GUI factory
interface along with a OS-specific buttons conforming to the button interface
and then builds a trivial GUI and paints its buttons.  The output will show the
OS-specific paint function being called when the button is drawn.
